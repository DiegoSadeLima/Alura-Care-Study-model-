# Alura-Care-Study-model-

# About

This project has the proposal to develop Alura_care, a fictional startup that aims to reduce the number of tests required for the diagnosis of a specific type of cancer. For this, data was pre-processed, learning to identify, for example, empty cells, and how to deal with this type of problem. Constant values ​​were also identified in the data and how they may or may not impact the classification process, in addition to how the correlation influences this same process.

That done, the automatic feature selection methods were used, such as SelectKBest and RFE. In addition, we were able to determine which set generated the best possible result in the classification process, how many features were needed and which are those features.

Finally, we will learn how to visualize high dimensional data in a plane, reducing the dimension but maintaining as much information as possible.
